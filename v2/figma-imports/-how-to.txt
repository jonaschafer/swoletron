### For any Figma Make import:

1. **Download from Figma Make** → place in `figma-imports/[feature-name]/`

2. **Give Cursor this prompt:**
```
   I have Figma Make code in figma-imports/[feature-name]/ that needs 
   to be integrated into Swoletron. Review the conversion guides in 
   figma-imports/ and convert this following the appropriate approach.
```

3. **Cursor will:**
   - Look at both markdown files
   - Assess the complexity
   - Pick the right approach
   - Do the conversion

## That's It

You don't need to decide which template - just point Cursor at the folder and let it choose. The two markdown files are **reference guides for Cursor**, not instructions for you.

### Example:
```
I have Figma Make code in figma-imports/exercise-history/ that needs 
to be integrated into Swoletron. Review the conversion guides in 
figma-imports/ and convert this following the appropriate approach.
```

Cursor reads both guides, sees it needs database changes, uses the detailed template, and gets to work.

**Even simpler:**
```
Convert figma-imports/exercise-history/ following figma-imports guides
