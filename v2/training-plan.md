## Downhill Confidence Protocol

**Why You're Slipping:**
1. Weak tibialis anterior (can't control foot on landing)
2. Weak glutes/hip stabilizers (knee tracks inward)
3. Tight calves (can't dorsiflex ankle for clearance)
4. Poor eccentric quad strength (can't "brake" smoothly)
5. Mental: Fear ‚Üí tension ‚Üí worse balance

**Strength Exercises (Built into plan):**
- ‚úÖ Eccentric step-downs (Weeks 3-11)
- ‚úÖ Single-leg balance on Bosu (All weeks)
- ‚úÖ Lateral step-downs (Weeks 10-11)
- ‚úÖ Calf raises (bent knee for soleus)
- ‚úÖ Bulgarian split squats (glute/quad strength)

**Running Drills (Add to Thursday warm-ups):**
1. Quick Feet Drill: 30sec on grass, tiny choppy steps, lean forward
2. Downhill Strides: 4-6√ó20sec fast-but-controlled downhill
3. Mud Walking: Before runs, walk through mud, practice "rolling" with slips

**Week 10 KEY WORKOUT:** Downhill Intervals
- Find 2-3min moderate downhill
- 5√óDOWN @ controlled fast pace (9:00-9:30/mi)
- Walk/jog up recovery
- Focus: light feet, quick cadence, trust your body

## Nutrition Notes

**For Body Composition (Pull-ups + Vanity Goals):**

You mentioned "love handles, man boobs, doughy chest." Strength alone won't fix this - need slight caloric deficit.

**Simple Framework:**
- Protein: 150-180g/day (0.8-1g per lb bodyweight)
- Carbs: HIGH on run days (Tue/Thu/Sun), moderate on rest days
- Fats: Don't fear them, but watch liquid calories
- Hydration: 100-120oz/day
- Alcohol: Biggest body comp saboteur

**Actionable:**
- Track food for 1 week (MyFitnessPal)
- Aim for ~2400-2600 cal/day (assuming ~2800 maintenance)
- Prioritize protein at breakfast
- Post-run: 3:1 carb-to-protein (chocolate milk, recovery drink)

**Pull-ups will be easier at lower body weight**, but you can build pulling strength regardless.

- Low back pain ‚Üí More core, check deadlift form
- Skipping 2+ sessions in a row ‚Üí Revisit adherence system

**Running:**
- Same injury recurring ‚Üí Strength imbalance, see PT
- Chronic fatigue ‚Üí Overtraining, add rest day
- Heart rate staying elevated ‚Üí Stress, sleep, or illness
- Not hitting paces ‚Üí Acceptable, focus on effort/time on feet

## Things You've Learned (From Your Notes)

‚úÖ Strength training is non-negotiable (2 days heavy + 3 days micro)
‚úÖ First 1-3 miles feel terrible (oxygen deprived - normal!)
‚úÖ Spring Energy > Gu/Clif (less rot gut)
‚úÖ New gels (90g carbs) > old gels
‚úÖ You lose 1100mg sodium/hour (need PN tablets + salt caps)
‚úÖ Hills: walk @ 16min/mile pace if steep
‚úÖ More vert = running faster easier
‚úÖ 15-20min strength is enough
‚úÖ Road shoes make a difference (Mach vs Challengers)
‚úÖ Volume makes running easier
‚úÖ Recovery: 3:1 drink within 30min, sleep 7+ hours
‚úÖ Easy running + Quality workouts > easy only
‚úÖ Add hills to easy days to run hills more easily

---

## Final Notes

This plan is realistic because:
- 30min strength sessions (not 60min crushers)
- Coordinated with run stress (no heavy squats after hill runs)
- Built-in down weeks (Week 6)
- Addresses YOUR specific injuries (ankle, calf, IT band, low back)
- Includes vanity goals (pull-ups, body comp) alongside performance
- Digital tracking (TrainingPeaks/app you'll build)
- Progressive but not reckless (30‚Üí42mpw is safe)

**You've got this.** üí™
