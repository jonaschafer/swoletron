## Downhill Confidence Protocol

**Why You're Slipping:**
1. Weak tibialis anterior (can't control foot on landing)
2. Weak glutes/hip stabilizers (knee tracks inward)
3. Tight calves (can't dorsiflex ankle for clearance)
4. Poor eccentric quad strength (can't "brake" smoothly)
5. Mental: Fear → tension → worse balance

**Strength Exercises (Built into plan):**
- ✅ Eccentric step-downs (Weeks 3-11)
- ✅ Single-leg balance on Bosu (All weeks)
- ✅ Lateral step-downs (Weeks 10-11)
- ✅ Calf raises (bent knee for soleus)
- ✅ Bulgarian split squats (glute/quad strength)

**Running Drills (Add to Thursday warm-ups):**
1. Quick Feet Drill: 30sec on grass, tiny choppy steps, lean forward
2. Downhill Strides: 4-6×20sec fast-but-controlled downhill
3. Mud Walking: Before runs, walk through mud, practice "rolling" with slips

**Week 10 KEY WORKOUT:** Downhill Intervals
- Find 2-3min moderate downhill
- 5×DOWN @ controlled fast pace (9:00-9:30/mi)
- Walk/jog up recovery
- Focus: light feet, quick cadence, trust your body

## Nutrition Notes

**For Body Composition (Pull-ups + Vanity Goals):**

You mentioned "love handles, man boobs, doughy chest." Strength alone won't fix this - need slight caloric deficit.

**Simple Framework:**
- Protein: 150-180g/day (0.8-1g per lb bodyweight)
- Carbs: HIGH on run days (Tue/Thu/Sun), moderate on rest days
- Fats: Don't fear them, but watch liquid calories
- Hydration: 100-120oz/day
- Alcohol: Biggest body comp saboteur

**Actionable:**
- Track food for 1 week (MyFitnessPal)
- Aim for ~2400-2600 cal/day (assuming ~2800 maintenance)
- Prioritize protein at breakfast
- Post-run: 3:1 carb-to-protein (chocolate milk, recovery drink)

**Pull-ups will be easier at lower body weight**, but you can build pulling strength regardless.

## Race Prep Timeline (Aug 9, 2026)

This 12-week plan ends **Jan 4, 2026**. You have **32 weeks until race day**.

**Suggested Build:**

**Jan-Feb (8 weeks):** Maintenance phase
- Hold gains: 35-40mpw, strength 2x/week

**Mar-May (12 weeks):** Build phase
- 40-50mpw, longer long runs, strength 2x/week

**Jun-Jul (8 weeks):** Peak phase
- 45-50mpw, back-to-back long runs, race-specific work

**Aug 1-9:** Taper
- 25-30mpw, light strength maintenance

---

## Success Criteria

**Phase 1 (Week 6) Success:**
✅ Consistent with 2 strength sessions per week
✅ Running 35-40 miles/week pain-free
✅ Can run downhills with less fear
✅ Completing micro-doses 3x/week

**Phase 2 (Week 9) Success:**
✅ Hit strength PRs (175lb deadlift, 135lb bench)
✅ Running 40 miles/week comfortably
✅ Can power hike 16min/mile pace on steep hills
✅ Negative pull-ups with 8sec descent

**Phase 3 (Week 12) Success:**

✅ Run 20 mile long run strong
✅ Technical descending confidence improved
✅ Feel durable, not fragile
✅ Ready to build toward Aug race

---

## Red Flags to Watch

**Strength Training:**
- IT band flare-up → Add extra clamshells + monster walks
- Calf tightness → Extra eccentric work + massage
- Low back pain → More core, check deadlift form
- Skipping 2+ sessions in a row → Revisit adherence system

**Running:**
- Same injury recurring → Strength imbalance, see PT
- Chronic fatigue → Overtraining, add rest day
- Heart rate staying elevated → Stress, sleep, or illness
- Not hitting paces → Acceptable, focus on effort/time on feet

---

## Things You've Learned (From Your Notes)

✅ Strength training is non-negotiable (2 days heavy + 3 days micro)
✅ First 1-3 miles feel terrible (oxygen deprived - normal!)
✅ Spring Energy > Gu/Clif (less rot gut)
✅ New gels (90g carbs) > old gels
✅ You lose 1100mg sodium/hour (need PN tablets + salt caps)
✅ Hills: walk @ 16min/mile pace if steep
✅ More vert = running faster easier
✅ 15-20min strength is enough
✅ Road shoes make a difference (Mach vs Challengers)
✅ Volume makes running easier
✅ Recovery: 3:1 drink within 30min, sleep 7+ hours
✅ Easy running + Quality workouts > easy only
✅ Add hills to easy days to run hills more easily

---

## Final Notes

This plan is realistic because:
- 30min strength sessions (not 60min crushers)
- Coordinated with run stress (no heavy squats after hill runs)
- Built-in down weeks (Week 6)
- Addresses YOUR specific injuries (ankle, calf, IT band, low back)
- Includes vanity goals (pull-ups, body comp) alongside performance
- Digital tracking (TrainingPeaks/app you'll build)
- Progressive but not reckless (30→42mpw is safe)

**You've got this.** 💪
