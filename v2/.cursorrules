# Code Quality and Type Safety Rules

## Before suggesting any code changes:

1. **Verify TypeScript compatibility**: Always verify that any code changes won't introduce TypeScript errors. Check that:
   - All types are properly defined
   - No implicit `any` types are introduced
   - Function signatures match their usage
   - Import/export statements are correct

2. **Add null checks**: For any nullable properties or values that might be `null` or `undefined`:
   - Add explicit null checks before accessing properties
   - Use optional chaining (`?.`) where appropriate
   - Provide sensible fallback values when needed
   - Use nullish coalescing (`??`) for default values

3. **Include all required properties**: When creating object literals:
   - Ensure all required properties from the interface/type are included
   - Verify property names match exactly (case-sensitive)
   - Don't omit required properties even if they seem optional

4. **Build verification reminder**: After making code changes:
   - Always remind the user to run `npm run build` before pushing to verify the changes compile correctly
   - If build errors occur, fix them before proceeding

5. **Type uncertainty**: If uncertain about types or interfaces:
   - Ask the user to share the interface/type definition first
   - Don't make assumptions about type structures
   - Verify type compatibility before implementing changes

## Additional Best Practices:

- Maintain consistency with existing code patterns
- Follow TypeScript strict mode requirements
- Ensure all async/await patterns are properly handled
- Check for potential runtime errors, not just compile-time errors

## Never Do:
- Never use `as any` or `@ts-ignore` unless absolutely necessary and documented
- Never skip type checking in favor of "just making it work"
- Never commit code that fails `npm run build`

## Pre-Commit Checklist:
Before any git commit, verify:
- [ ] Code compiles: `npm run build` passes
- [ ] No TypeScript errors in editor
- [ ] All null checks are in place
- [ ] Required properties are present in object literals
